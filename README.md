Foundation's Main Motive!

This Organization was created to bring people together into coding and making internet sites free and open for everyone, Not limited to just websites but any tech that runs through the veins of the internet!

It's just starting so it's empty, but I'm actively working on my first steps towards creating a better Organization.
